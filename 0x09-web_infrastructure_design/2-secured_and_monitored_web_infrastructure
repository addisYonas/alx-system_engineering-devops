	1.we are adding firewalls for enhancing our security
	2,A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing 		
	network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
	3.Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol  
	over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. 		
	The ‘S’ at the end of HTTPS stands for ‘Secure’. It means all communications between your 		
	browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential 		
	online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.
	4.Just as the heart monitor in a hospital that is making sure that a patient’s heart is b
	eating and at the right beat, software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, 
	and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.
	 5. Data is constantly collected when an application or a server is
        doing it's job. It's performance, availability, user experiences are
        constantly being monitored. This data will then be changed to readable
	form. So If there is a glitch it will be caught immediately and dealt 
	with.
        6. We first set up monitoring tools. This tools are able to monitor 
	metrics. When they do so, the can monitor the quieres per second, to 
	see if it can handle the traffic and if it is scalable enough for the 
	incoming traffic.
	
	
Issues with the infrastructure:
        1. If one applies for SSL termination it will affect sensitive data
        while making transactions because transaction should be made in a
        secured connection.
        2. Any changes that this Master makes the all the changes will also be
        replicated on the slave, data can be lost easily.
        3. The problem is failure in that server will fail all of these
        components.
